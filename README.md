# Leet Speak Converter

Leet speak is a term for the style of typing that replaces letters with numbers or symbols that resemble them, e.g. leet becomes 1337. Speak might become 5p3@k. There is a variety of different character substitutions (Wikipedia for leetLinks to an external site.), but here is the translation table we will use for this assignment:

a -> @
A -> 4
B, b -> 8
E, e -> 3
I, i -> !
L, l -> 1
O, o -> 0
S, s -> 5
Create a function convert(text: str) -> str that accepts a string, converts the string to leet speak using the conversion table above, and returns the converted string. No other changes should be made to the string.
